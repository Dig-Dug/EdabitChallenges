/**
 * The Farm Problem
 * In this challenge, a farmer is asking you
   to tell him how many legs can be counted 
  among all his animals. The farmer breeds three species:
   chickens = 2 legs
   cows = 4 legs
   pigs = 4 legs
 The farmer has counted his animals and he gives you a subtotal 
 for each species. You have to implement a function that 
 returns the total number of legs of all the animals.
 
	Examples
	animals(2, 3, 5) ➞ 36
	animals(1, 2, 3) ➞ 22
	animals(5, 2, 8) ➞ 50

	Test.assertEquals(animals(5, 2, 8), 50)
	Test.assertEquals(animals(3, 4, 7), 50)
	Test.assertEquals(animals(1, 2, 3), 22)
							 2, 8, 14
	Test.assertEquals(animals(3, 5, 2), 34)

The order of animals passed is animals(chickens, cows, pigs).
Remember that the farmer wants to know the total
 number of legs and not the total number of animals.

function animals(chickens, cows, pigs) {
	chickens = 2;
	cows = 3;
	pigs  = 5;

	console.log("jijiji",(chickens* 2) + (cows*4 ) + (pigs*4));
	return (chickens* 2) + (cows*4 ) + (pigs*4);
	
}
/**OTHER ANSWERS
 * 
 * return chickens*2+(cows+pigs)*4;
 * const animals = (chickens, cows, pigs) => chickens * 2 + cows * 4 + pigs * 4;
